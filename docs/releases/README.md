# Human-first release notes

GitHub releases are product communication, not a copy of the commit log. Keep
`CHANGELOG.md` as the technical, generated history and add one curated file here
for every public tag.

## Required structure

Each `vX.Y.Z.md` file must include:

1. **Why this release matters** — the problem it solves in everyday language.
2. **What changed** — grouped by operator outcome rather than code area.
3. **Before you use it** — limitations, migration notes, and any proof that is
   still missing.
4. **Downloads** — a link to the matching GitHub release and a clear platform
   availability note.

Write for owners, managers, and cashiers first. Put implementation detail in a
short technical appendix or link to the generated changelog. Never imply fiscal
certification, hardware qualification, cloud operation, support coverage, or a
delivery date without fresh evidence.

## Release flow

Before merging a Release Please PR:

1. determine the version proposed by the PR;
2. add `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` to `main` with the structure above;
3. verify every claim against `docs/PROJECT-STATUS.md` and the release-candidate
   evidence;
4. run `pnpm run ci:release`;
5. wait for the `Curated release notes` status on the PR to pass.

`ci:release` fails while no curated note exists for the version in
`.release-please-manifest.json`. That check exists because v1.11.0 through
v1.14.1 and v1.14.3 were released without one: the publishing job checks out the
tag, so a note added afterwards reaches the release only by editing it by hand.

That check does not run on its own on a Release Please PR. Its commits come from
`github-actions[bot]`, so GitHub holds the PR's CI run as `action_required` until
a maintainer approves it under Actions. The `Curated release notes` status needs
no approval: after every push to `main`, `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`
posts it on the open Release Please PR, failing while `main` has no valid note
for the version the PR proposes and passing once it has one. The note belongs on
`main`, not on the PR branch, which Release Please rewrites whenever it updates
the PR. Because the note lives on `main`, the PR diff never shows it; the status
is where to confirm it. `main` requires no status checks, so neither the status
nor the CI run stops the PR from merging on its own.

After Release Please creates the tag and a **draft** release,
`.github/workflows/release-please.yml` checks out that exact tag and replaces
the generated GitHub release body with the curated file. The artifact workflow
must receive a draft: published releases are immutable and cannot accept new
installers. It validates the tagged web flows, builds and uploads every
distributable artifact, deploys the update feed, then publishes the draft. For
manual recovery, create the draft at the versioned `main` tag and dispatch
`release.yml`; never publish an empty release before that workflow succeeds.
The generated `CHANGELOG.md` remains available for commit-level detail.
